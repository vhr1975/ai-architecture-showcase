# Order Service (ecommerce microservices)

Summary
-------
Placeholder README for the Order service. The order service is responsible for accepting orders, validating payment and inventory availability, and orchestrating order lifecycle events.

What this demonstrates
----------------------
- Service orchestration and integration with payment and inventory
- Use of events to decouple order processing steps

Tech
----
- HTTP API backed by a small database; can publish events to message broker for async processing.

Quick start / scaffold
----------------------
Scaffold a small service here to accept POST /orders with order payloads. In a test environment you can mock payment and inventory integrations.

Notes for learners
------------------
- Consider idempotency for order creation and use events for long-running workflows.
